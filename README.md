# FinJect - Locating App For Visually Impaired Users
Creating an environment where we can aid the visually impaired users. 
FinJect provides with an option of using Object Tagging and Image Detection. 
Object tagging is done through BLE tags which are attached to the objects like bottles, wallet, keys etc. and then with simple voice interaction these tags are triggered(makes beeping sound) and are then located  by the users based on sound.
The image detection is a simple YOLO model which uses text to speech recognition and informs the user of its surrounding with the help of smartphone camera.
